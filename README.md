### ‚öôÔ∏èUsage

Basic command:

```

#### Arguments

Website: The URL of the target WordPress site (e.g., http://example.com).

### üìö Example

python3 Wp-Explorer.py http://example.com
```

### üîçHow It Works

1. WordPress Detection:

The tool checks for key WordPress-specific paths **(wp-login.php, wp-admin/, wp-content/)** to verify if the target website is running WordPress.


2. Path Scanning:

  Reads paths from paths.txt and sends HTTP requests to the target website.
  Outputs the status code for each path:

    - 200: Path exists.
    - 404: Path does not exist.
    - Other codes (e.g., 403, 401): Restricted access or errors.

3. Saving Results:

If specified with -o, results are saved to the provided filename.
